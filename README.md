# Traffic_light_controller1
ABOUT THE MINI PROJECT

Implement a traffic light control system for a four-lane
intersection, ensuring that the duration of green lights for each
direction is dynamically adjusted based on the number of vehicles
present. Specically, green lights should last 90 seconds for lanes with
over 30 vehicles, 60 seconds for lanes with 20 to 30 vehicles, and 45
seconds for lanes with fewer than 20 vehicles. Additionally, if a lane
has no vehicles, the green light should be transferred to another lane.
Implement the following in Vivado and prepare a report for time,
resource, and power analysis with the required waveform results.

for real-time observation fristly dump the code in FPGA board, connect a camera input to the FPGA inputs by using sensors we can detect the vehicles on the road.
according to the count of vehicles the signal timer starts and ends. 

the main moto to reduce traffic on roads.
